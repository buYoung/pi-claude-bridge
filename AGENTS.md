# Agent Guidelines

## Restricted Actions

Do **not** auto-commit.

Do **not** interact with the public without explicit permission. For example, do not open PRs or comment on github issues unless I say so.

## Claims about how Claude Code behaves

`~/.claude/projects/**` is **not** evidence of what CC does -- the bridge writes there too, and CC re-serializes imported records under synthetic ids. Split by provenance (CC-live: real `requestId`/`promptId`; ours: `msg_syn_*`/`req_syn_*`) and regroup by `message.id` (`diag/audit-transcripts.mjs` does both).

Better: prove it with a live probe. `tests/int-cc-contracts.mjs` pins undocumented behavior against the installed CC/SDK; `diag/capture-proxy.mjs` captures request bodies. `claude-code-rip/` is mechanism only, never current behavior. Before reverse-engineering an SDK option, grep `node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk/sdk.d.ts` first.

Validate any *rate* from the debug log on a case whose answer you know. Bin by era before comparing groups -- a window straddling the onset credits whatever else changed.

Five wrong conclusions across two sessions came from skipping the above.

## Changelog

Maintain an entry in the `## UNRELEASED` section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md` for every significant change, using the existing format:

```
- **Tag: summary** — detail
```

Do not add changelog entries for docs-only changes. Combine multiple UNRELEASED entries about the same feature into one.

Tags: `Add`, `Fix`, `Refactor`, `Tests`, `Bump`, `Deprecate`, `Remove`.

## Release

No build step — the package ships `src` TypeScript as-is (see `files` in `package.json`). Releases are cut by the user, never by an agent: `npm run release` on a clean `main` asks for the version, then confirms commit, tag and push one at a time (release-it, `.release-it.json`). Along the way it:

1. **Checks** — fails unless `## UNRELEASED` has entries, then runs `typecheck` and `test:unit`.
2. **Bumps** — `package.json`/`package-lock.json` to `X.Y.Z`, and renames `## UNRELEASED` to `## X.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD` (`scripts/changelog.mjs`).
3. **Commits, tags, pushes** — `Release X.Y.Z`, annotated tag `vX.Y.Z`, pushed together.

The pushed tag triggers `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, which re-runs the checks, publishes to npm through trusted publishing (OIDC, no token) and creates the GitHub Release from that version's changelog section.

## Tests

Smoke tests typically need to run outside a sandbox because they access local pi/Claude settings and auth state.
